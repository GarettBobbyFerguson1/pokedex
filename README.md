# pokemon_guesser
simple PyQt5 gui app that lets you receive details about any pokemon.
Just type the name of your desired pokemon and press 'Get Data'

**features**
-shows height and weight in metric units
-lists abilities and 5 of its moves.

##how its made and what i learnt
**tech used** : Python
I got the idea to incorporate a pokemon encyclopedia with a GUI. This is my first tme working with a GUI, i learnt how to create buttons , text labels and input fields. I then proceeded to create 3 functions: 
1)Receive the data from the Pokeapi site.
2)error handling incase of network issues or incorrect names being typed.
3)Present the pokemon details
. I also learned how to customize my gui.

##future enhancements
I will like to improve upon the visual look of the GUI . I will also like to add a image of the pokemon next to the description for a better overall user experience. Maybe add sound effects of each pokemon .
